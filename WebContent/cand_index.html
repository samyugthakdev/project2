  <div class="top-left"><br><p  style="text-align:left">As technology advances at lightning-fast speed, the recruitment industry is under immense pressure to attract (and retain) the best talent â€“ quickly and cost-effectively. HR departments are always on the lookout to streamline their interview process.
  Deploying a technology-backed Interview Management System is a great way to make the interview process efficient, reduce the time to hire, efficiently schedule and set up interviews, and track them over time.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left">In the hiring process, interviews are one of the most expensive elements as they need valuable resources to be available to conduct the interviews. Using such an online interview process, companies can make faster, evidence-based hiring decisions. By having a ready bank of test questions,
  the Interview Management System can help companies eliminate the need to interview every single candidate, remove bias, and save time on the hiring process.</p>
  <h3 style="text-align:left">Job Descriptions:</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left">Once the company profile is set up, the next step is to set up a Job Description . Providing an updated and accurate job description is critical in hiring the best talent. We created a feature in the product that allows seamless creation, management, storage, and integration of hundreds of job descriptions with ease.</p>
  <h3 style="text-align:left">Inviting the candidates:</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left">Another key feature needed in the product was to allow recruiters to invite candidates to enter the hiring process for a Job Description either one-by-one or en masse. The hiring process could include a pre-screen test followed by an interview or for certain specific positions, a direct interview.
  On receiving an invite, candidates should be able to register on the portal and appear for an online test for the given job description. The client wanted to track all the invites based on whether the candidate opened the invite mail, or they registered using the same or no.</p>
  <h3 style="text-align:left">Company Registration, Profile & User Management:</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left">Since this was a product that would be used by HR professionals in companies, the product needed the following features
  <p style="text-align:left">1.A way for companies to onboard their own users & assign roles to them</p>
  <p style="text-align:left">2.A way to manage their logo & information for each company - this would be showcased to candidates applying for a job</p>
  <p style="text-align:left">3.Linking of the company profile to their careers page, job portals, social media platforms, and more</p>
